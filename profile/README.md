## About Us

KaiGE's Organization is dedicated to developing and promoting the KaiGE game engine, a modern and versatile engine written in Rust. Our mission is to create a simple to use graphical game engine that allows developers to create whatever games they would like.
## Features

> [!NOTE]
> This checklist shows what the engine currently contains.

- [x] **Rust-Powered:** KaiGE takes full advantage of Rust's memory safety and performance, providing a robust foundation for game development.

- [ ] **Extensible:** The engine is designed to be extensible, allowing you to easily integrate third-party libraries and tools into your game development workflow.
